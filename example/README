Note that this syntheic example was particularly designed for testing the error tolerance 
for elastic-wave-equation based time-lapse inversion. 

1. true baseline model: model1 
2. true time-lapse model: model1 + model perturturbation (1%)
3. input baseline model for time-lapse inversion: model 2 (the difference with model 1 is about 6% - 12%).

We don't use model 1 as the input baseline model for time-lapse inversion, because in the real world, no one knows 
exactly the true baseline model. In many cases, the model errors in the known baseline model is larger than the 
subsurface physical properties.
